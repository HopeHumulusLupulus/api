You need at least php **5.4.*** with **SQLite extension** enabled and **Composer**
    
    composer install 
    phinx migrate
    php -S 0:9001 -t web/

Your api is now available at http://localhost:9001/api/v1.

####Run tests
Some tests were written, and all CRUD operations are fully tested :)

From the root folder run the following command to run tests.
    
    vendor/bin/phpunit 


####What you will get
The api will respond to

	GET  ->   http://localhost:9001/api/v1/pins
	POST ->   http://localhost:9001/api/v1/pins
	PUT ->   http://localhost:9001/api/v1/pins/{id}
	DELETE -> http://localhost:9001/api/v1/pins/{id}

Your request should have 'Content-Type: application/json' header.
Your api is CORS compliant out of the box, so it's capable of cross-domain communication.

Try with curl:
	
	#GET
	curl http://localhost:9001/api/v1/notes -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -w "\n"

	#POST (insert)
	curl -X POST http://localhost:9001/api/v1/notes -d '{"note":"Hello World!"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -w "\n"

	#PUT (update)
